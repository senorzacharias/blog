Capstone Project

This food blog is a (less than) two week paired programming final project.
The only part of this project I did not have a part in was the Identity Authorization and Role Management that my partner, Jason Florin, implemented after my setup of Entity-- I take no credit for this part of the project.
I designed and wrote the entire UI using a SAP Restful Web Api design with JavaScript and the jQuery library. I also setup Entity Framework and coded the repository, in addition to making changes to the BLL to support the DbContext. This backend work was done in collaboration with Jason. 
Note: The project had not been planned with me taking on so much responsibility, but after Jason had already completed the Dapper repo, we decided to switch to Entity, as Identity is integrated nicely with the framework. I had used both Entity and Dapper so I took over the repo and DB setup so that we could stay on schedule. It was fun, Jason!
